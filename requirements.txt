# requirements.txt

# Core numerical and scientific libraries
numpy>=1.20.0,<2.0.0  # For numerical operations, restricted to version 1.x (e.g., 1.26.x is common)
scipy>=1.7.0          # For signal processing (filters, STFT, etc.)

# Audio processing
librosa>=0.9.0        # For audio loading, resampling, and analysis features
soundfile>=0.11.0     # For reading and writing audio files

# Machine Learning / GPU support (if PyTorch MPS is used)
torch>=1.12.0         # For potential GPU acceleration (MPS on macOS)
# Note: torchvision and torchaudio are not directly used in this script,
# but often installed alongside PyTorch. Keeping it minimal for now.

# System utilities
psutil>=5.8.0         # For system and process utilities (CPU count, memory usage)

# Optional but recommended for development/debugging
# logging (built-in)
# warnings (built-in)
# gc (built-in)
# os (built-in)
# subprocess (built-in)
# multiprocessing (built-in)
# concurrent.futures (built-in)
